Welcome on AliSoftware's GitHub Repository

This repository is intended to share some bits of codes (frameworks, categories, reusable classes, ...) I developped for my MacOSX or iPhone apps in Cocoa or some useful files to ease my Cocoa Development.

Feel free to send me some comments or feedbacks if you use this at olivier.halligon+ae@gmail.com.
