This Objective-C framework aims to add support to JSON-RPC to your Cocoa projects, so that you can easily call JSON-RPC WebServices from your application and handle the responses.

 - To use the framework, simply drag & drop the "AliJSONRPC Framework" directory in your Xcode Project.
 - A sample project is available in the "Examples/" directory
 - For more information, see the doxygen documentation (available as an Xcode DocSet) in "Documentation/"
